'''
Create variables for each player (health, player type,
experience points, player username, and if the player has a weapon)
'''
playerHealth = 100
playerType = "Swordmaster"
expPoints = 20823.2
playerUsername = "SmartSword123"

'''
Create three (or more) strings (stored in variables) of your adventure game story!
Essentially, make a story about the character you defined above.
You should use all variables in the creation of your three string variables
'''
story1 = playerUsername + " is an amazing " + playerType + " that is strong, noble, and cool."
story2 = "Currently, " + playerUsername + " has " + str(playerHealth) + " health points; they are healthy."
story3 = "To add, " + playerUsername + " has " + str(expPoints) + " experience points!"
story4 = "A villager asks, \"Does " + playerUsername + " have a sword?\" We know that the answer is " + str(hasWeapon) + "."
