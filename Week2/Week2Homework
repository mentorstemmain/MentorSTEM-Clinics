# Build upon the code from your project!
# Make player-specific variables (like health points, etc) that decrease or increase upon a certain choice

# CHALLENGE:
# Isn't it annoying having to restart to play the game?
# Don't you want to play multiple rounds?
# Try learning while loops... and implement them!
