# Your task is to create a treasure game (with limited options)
# Look to the example for inspiration or follow the guide lines below!

# Create a variable and use input() to save the user's answer to a question
# that asks if they would like to start the game

# Use a while loop to run if the user response variable is equal to yes/Y/etc
# Within the while loop, save the user's choice for movement (left/right/etc)
# Use if-else or if statements to print the result
# Ask the user if they want to continue playing and save result to response variable

# Print a last comment for the user who played the game!
