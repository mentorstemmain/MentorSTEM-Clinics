# Create a pet simulation game (refer to the example if you need an idea of how it will work)!
# First create three lists (one for pet names, one for the health level of each pet, and one for the energy level of each pet)
# Then ask the user if they want to start the game
# Use this input to start a while loop that loops one round of the simulation
# Within each round, the user must be able to play or feed the pets HOW MANY TIMES THEY WANT to WHICHEVER PET THEY WANT
# Ask the user if they want to continue playing, if not “break” out of the while loop

# Challenge section!: Explore Gamemaker (the platform where we'll learn video game development) & make this pet simulation game as realistic as possible!
